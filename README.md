# Social-Network
In this repo, I attempted to recreate the backend of a social network application. It will include functionality such as liking/commenting on a post, authentication through real Instagram username and password, sending/accepting/rejecting friends' request, etc. The front-end will be in PUG and quite basic as this will be more backend-focused
