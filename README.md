# Social-Network
In this repo, I attempted to recreate the backend of a social network application. It will include functionality such as liking/commenting on a post, authentication through real Facebook username and password, sending/accepting/rejecting friends' request, viewing friends' posts, suggesting new friends, etc. 

To run this application, run "npm run devStart" into the terminal 

NOTE: To perform tests, you have to change the code in index.js file (comments as how to change the code are included in there)
